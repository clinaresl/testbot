to comment the syntax of the tests definition file

there is nothing to automatically do like checking what instances have
been solved and which are valid. This should be stored in the
definition of the database schema

testbot captures the stdout of the solver but not the stdout of its
children. And it cannot, indeed! The question is that it is its parent
(the solver invoked by the testbot) who has to properly forward the
standard output of its children. In general, testboot tries to make as
little assumptions about the behaviour of the solvers as possible.

the timeline might not be accurate if the solver does not terminate
its children properly ---if it does not kill them then the os will
keep them alive until the solver dies and the testbot will write the
end time of the children the same endtime of the solver though the
children might have become zombie processes.

Also, testboot, cannot properly measure memory. In particular, it
computes the sum of the memory used by the solver and its children but
they might be sharing memory and, instead, it will sum this memory
several times.

testbot Version 2.0


# Introduction #

Testbot is a Python package that monitors the execution of (hopefully)
any executable under any OS that provides a `/proc` filesystem (i.e.,
Linux) and that parses the contents of any text file. Testbot is
mainly intended to be used for scientific experimentation.

It consists of three main components:

1. Package `autobot`: it provides the main services for programmers to
automate/monitor the execution of their programs and to parse text
files.

2. Script `parsebot`: it uses the services provided by `autobot` to
parse and manipulate data extracted from any text file.

3. Script `testbot`: it uses the services provided by `autobot` to be
run under simple scenarios.

`autobot` parses two input files:

* tb file: it contains the description of the command line arguments
  to be passed to the executable. Every command line consists of a
  single execution of the executable. tb files are encoded in a
  specific (very simple) language

* db file: it defines the schema of all tables to be stored by autobot
  as a result of the experimentation. They are defined also with a
  (very simple) language. These tables can contain a bunch of data
  including data retrieved from the standard output/error generated by
  the executable or other particular data accessed by other Python
  modules. In particular, the db language recognizes the following
  variables:

	+ Sys variables: these variables are computed at every cycle
	(i.e., immediately after the underlying process is
	pinged). They are preceded by the character `:` or the prefix
	`sys`

	+ Main variables: the value of any directive passed to any
	script (either `testbot` or `parsebot`). They are preceded by
	the character `_` or the prefix `main`

	+ Data variables: strings (either single or doubled quoted
	just in case they contain blank characters) that are matched
	in the standard output/error of the process given to `testbot`
	or the file given to `parsebot`. In case they are found, the
	value appearing immediately after is used as its value. They
	are preceded by the character `?` or the prefix `data`

	+ File variables: strings (either single or doubled quoted
	just in case they contain blank characters) that identify
	files whose contents are copied as their value. They are
	preceded by the character `<` or the prefix `file`

	+ Directive variables: the value of any directive passed to
	the executable (which are specified in the test specification
	file) identified by the directive name. They are used only by
	`testbot`. They are preceded by the character `@` or the
	prefix `dir`

	+ Parameters: the value of any directive passed to the
	executable (which are specified in the test specification
	file) identified by their location. They are used only by
	`testbot`. They are preceded by the character `$` or the
	prefix `param`

	+ User variables: strings (either single or doubled quoted
	just in case they contain blank characters) that contain
	information specific to third-party software. They are
	preceded by the character `~` or the prefix `user`

	+ Regular expressions: regexps are defined separately in the
	database specification file and can be used in the
	specification of database tables to refer to the various
	groups that result every time a match is found. Importantly,
	regexps can be compound to create *contexts* where the output
	of one regular expression is given to the next one. The head
	of a context can be any variable (or a snippet defined below),
	but a regexp.

	+ Snippets: (Python) snippets are also defined separately in
	the database specification file and can be used in the
	specification of database tables to refer to the different
	output variables that are computed by the (Python) snippet.

Depending upon the information stored in every table, they can be of
different types:

	+ Sys tables: they store *only* sys variables. Sys tables are
	populated with information extracted in every cycle of the
	execution

	+ Data tables: they hold any type of variable but sys
	variables. They are populated with information extracted after
	the execution of a particular solver or the parsing of a
	specific file.

	+ User tables: they can not contain sys variables and are
	never used by autobot. They are just defined for giving
	third-party software the possibility to store private
	information.

While `autobot` accepts an arbitrary selection of text files,
`testbot` accepts an arbitrary selection of *solvers* specified with
regular expressions. The information retrieved from either script is
then available in sqlite3 databases that can be used later to access
data or to plot figures directly (e.g., using pipelines in gnuplot).


# Installation #

Download the software cloning the Mercurial repository with the
following command:

    $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/clinares/testbot

a directory called `testbot` will be automatically created. Go to that
directory and execute the script `setup.py` as indicated below:

    $ cd testbot
    $ sudo ./setup.py install

In case this software is being reinstalled, make sure to add `--force`
to overwrite the previous package.


# How to use #

The simplest usage of autobot is exemplified with the script
`testbot`. It takes the following mandatory arguments:

* solver: regular expression that identifies all executables to
  monitor

* test: test specification file in the tb language

* db: db specification file in the db language

* timeout: maximum allotted time in seconds

* memory: maximum allotted memory in gigabytes

Other optional parameters that affect the behaviour of testbot are:

* check: seconds elapsed between successive pings to the running
  executable. Autobot will gather some statistics at every ping (sys
  variables)

* output: prefix used in the name of the files that record the
  standard output and standard error of every execution. Placeholders
  can be used. To see a comprehensive list of the available
  placeholders type:

      $ testbot.py --show-placeholders

* directory: target directory where all information is
  recorded. autobot automatically creates a subdirectory per
  executable and stores: config information, system information and
  the standard output and standard error generated

* bz2: in case the standard output/error might be huge, it is feasible
  to compress it with bzip2.

It also provides additional services for configuring the logging
services or to test whether the db/tb files are correctly parsed. In
particular, to see the results of parsing the test specification file
type:

    $ testbot.py --parse-tests

Analagously, to see the results of parsing the database specification
file type the following:

    $ testbot.py --parse-db

All of this information can be accessed with:

    $ testbot.py --help

Configuration files are provided under examples/ For instance, try:

    $ testbot.py --solver examples/solvers/eperimeter 
    --test examples/tests/8puzzle.tb 
    --db examples/db/example.db 
    --timeout 5 --memory 2 --check 0 --bz2

and examine the contents of the directory eperimeter/ just created

Programmer's Guide of testbot

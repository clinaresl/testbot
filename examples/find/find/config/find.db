# database tables
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# admin tables including 'admin', 'tests', 'time', 'timeline', 'status'
# and 'version' are created systematically
#
# there are three different types of tables:
#
#    sys tables: they should start with 'sys_'. They are polled after
#                every cycle
#
#    data tables: they should start with 'data_'. They are polled after
#                 every execution
#
#    user tables: they should start with 'user_'. They are out of reach
#                 of autobot and they are polled instead by third-party 
#                 software using the services of autobot
